description: Technical breakdown of PolinaOS multi-agent system.
---
PolinaOS runs on a **multi-agent AI system**.
Each agent is specialized and communicates through structured JSON outputs and verifiable pipelines.
Together they form the **closed-loop intelligence layer** that powers task automation and reward allocation.

---

### 1. 🧠 Analyst Agent – Polina
*AI researcher & context builder*

- 📡 **Context Loading**
  → Scrapes **Twitter timelines**, **contract mentions**, **on-chain events**.
  → Uses Puppeteer + RPC clients to rebuild the project’s **narrative landscape**.

- 🗂️ **Knowledge Memory**
  → Pulls past missions + contributor data from **PolinaOS DB**.
  → Enables **incremental analysis** (no re-learning from scratch).

- 📊 **Signal Collection**
  → Finds top tweets, memes, influencer replies, engagement baselines.
  → Detects abnormal attention spikes via **statistical thresholds**.

- 🧾 **Project Understanding Generation**
  → Outputs structured JSON:
    ```json
    {
      "strengths": [...],
      "weaknesses": [...],
      "activation_opportunities": [...]
    }
    ```
  → Feeds into Creator Agent.

### 2. ✨ Creator Agent – Lara
*AI task designer, optimized for Twitter virality*

- 🎯 **Mission Framing**
  → Selects high-value tweets/narratives for amplification.
  → Uses **contextual embeddings** to detect “shill-worthy” content.

- 📝 **Task Design**
  → Generates prompts with hashtags, media, reward rules.
  → Embeds **cultural priors** (CT memes, slang, timing windows).

- 📦 **Dynamic Packaging**
  → Outputs tasks in schema:
    ```json
    {
      "objective": "...",
      "deadline": "...",
      "kpis": ["views", "engagements"],
      "tiers": ["basic", "advanced", "viral"]
    }
    ```

- 🔄 **Adaptive Iteration**
  → Monitors early submissions.
  → Auto-generates A/B variants of prompts for higher engagement.

---

### 3. 🎯 Scoring Agent – Zero
*Autonomous evaluator & reputation engine*

- ✅ **Task Matching**
  → Uses semantic search + regex/rule validation.
  → Verifies tweet/post contains required **hashtags, media, timing**.

- 🧮 **Effort & Originality Scoring**
  → LLM-powered analysis of **tone, length, novelty**.
  → Penalizes template spam & rewards authentic, thoughtful content.

- 🚫 **Sybil & Spam Filtering**
  → Cross-checks:
    - Wallet activity (on-chain)
    - Twitter history
    - Submission duplication
  → Blacklists repeated farming patterns.

- 🧠 **Reputation Memory**
  → Maintains contributor history:
    - `score_total`
    - `score_avg`
    - `sybil_flags`
  → Adjusts reward weighting dynamically.

- 📤 **Output Schema**
  ```json
  {
    "contributor": "0x...",
    "task_id": "12345",
    "score": 87,
    "flags": ["sybil_suspected"],
    "notes": "Low effort retweet"
  }
