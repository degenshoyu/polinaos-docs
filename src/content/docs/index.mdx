## Introduction

PolinaOS is an **AI-native operating system for digital communities**.

Originally designed for and currently supporting **Web3 tokenized projects**, it will in the future support any team with a digital presence looking to coordinate tasks, analyze projects, engage contributors, and distribute rewards autonomously.

Powered by a **multi-agent AI system** ‚Äî
- **üß† Analyst Agent Polina** ¬∑ delivers project insights
- **‚ú® Creator Agent Lara** ¬∑ generates and publishes missions
- **üéØ Scoring Agent Zero** ¬∑ evaluates contributions and allocates rewards

PolinaOS automates everything from **project analysis** and mission generation to shill detection, scoring, and token rewards, while continuously refining campaigns in a closed feedback loop that helps communities grow smarter over time.
