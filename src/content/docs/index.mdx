PolinaOS is an AI-native operating system for digital communities. Originally designed for Web3 projects, it now supports any team with a digital presence looking to coordinate tasks, engage contributors, and distribute rewards efficiently and autonomously.

It automates everything from mission generation to shill detection, scoring, and token reward distribution combining Twitter data, on-chain proof, and a multi-agent AI system.
