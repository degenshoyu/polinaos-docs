title: Architecture & Workflow
description: How PolinaOS coordinates contributors, evaluates impact, and automates rewards.
---

PolinaOS is a modular coordination system designed to help digital-native projects automate community growth. While Web3 has accelerated this trend — with small teams launching DAOs, tokens, and experiments at scale — the need for scalable, intelligent coordination applies to any project with a public presence.

Instead of relying on spreadsheets, Discord mods, or Google Forms, PolinaOS uses AI agents and public data to manage missions, monitor performance, and allocate rewards — autonomously.

## 🔁 Modular Workflow Overview

1. 🧑‍💻 Creator inputs mission context
   ⬇
2. 🤖 **AI Task Generator** creates weekly tasks
   ⬇
3. 🧵 Contributors post on Twitter / perform on-chain tasks
   ⬇
4. 🔍 **Twitter Scanner** collects public signals
   ⬇
5. 🧠 **Scoring Engine** filters bots & ranks users
   ⬇
6. 🎯 **Reward System** allocates tokens
   ⬇
7. 🌐 **Claim Portal** (Solana-based) lets users redeem rewards

Each step is modular and can be integrated independently. Combined, they create a fully automated contribution loop — from mission design to verifiable impact to reward delivery.
