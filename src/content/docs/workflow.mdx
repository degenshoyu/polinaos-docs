title: Architecture & Workflow
description: How PolinaOS collects data, analyzes signals, coordinates contributors, and automates rewards.
---

PolinaOS is a modular coordination system designed to help digital-native projects automate community growth. While Web3 has accelerated this trend — with small teams launching DAOs, tokens, and experiments at scale — the need for scalable, intelligent coordination applies to any project with a public presence.

Instead of relying on spreadsheets, Discord mods, or Google Forms, PolinaOS uses AI agents, public data, and on-chain proof to manage missions, monitor performance, analyze sentiment, and allocate rewards — autonomously.

## 🔁 Modular Workflow Overview

1. 🧑‍💻 Creator inputs mission context
   ⬇
2. 📊 **Project Intelligence Layer** collects project signals (Twitter, on-chain, token metadata) and generates dashboards such as Project Leaderboard & KOL Leaderboard
   ⬇
3. 🤖 **AI Task Generator** creates weekly missions based on project analysis and market signals
   ⬇
4. 🧵 Contributors post on Twitter / perform on-chain actions
   ⬇
5. 🔍 **Community Scanner** tracks tweets, wallets, and activity data with timestamp accuracy
   ⬇
6. 🧠 **Scoring Engine** performs sentiment analysis, filters bots, and ranks contributors by verified impact
   ⬇
7. 🎯 **Reward System** allocates tokens based on scores
   ⬇
8. 🌐 **Claim Portal** (Solana-based) lets users redeem rewards trustlessly

Each step is modular and can be integrated independently. Combined, they create a fully automated intelligence-to-reward loop — from project analysis to mission design to verifiable impact measurement.

## 🧩 Advanced Workflow Customization

While PolinaOS provides a default closed-loop pipeline, advanced users can design **custom workflows** using a visual editor — similar to n8n.

This system allows teams to drag-and-drop modules such as:

- **Data Inputs**: Twitter search, wallet scans, token metadata, sentiment feeds
- **AI Agents**: Analyst (insights), Creator (missions), Scoring (evaluation), Reward (allocation)
- **Actions**: Publish mission, update leaderboard, trigger Telegram/Discord bot, execute on-chain contract
- **Conditions & Branching**: “If sentiment < 40% → trigger crisis mission”, “If token volume spikes → launch shill quest”
- **Integrations**: Solana RPC, EVM RPC, external APIs (DexScreener, GeckoTerminal), webhooks

The **visual workflow builder** makes it possible to:

- Orchestrate **multi-agent pipelines** without coding
- Insert **custom data transforms** (filters, enrichment, ML models)
- Connect to **third-party tools** for analytics, marketing, or governance
- Run **parallel or conditional flows** depending on project state

### Example Use Case

- Token price spikes → PolinaOS auto-detects → Creator Agent generates an urgent shilling mission → published to Mission Board → Scoring Agent ranks contributors → Reward Agent distributes tokens → summary report posted to Telegram.

With this customization layer, PolinaOS evolves from a **fixed OS** into a **programmable coordination engine** where every project can craft its own intelligence-to-action loop.
